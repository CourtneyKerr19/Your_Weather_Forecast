# Your_Weather_Forecast
Single Page Weather Application using JavaScript and a public API.

DESCRIPTION
For my Phase-1 project at Flatiron School, I was tasked with creating a single-page application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while incorporating a public API to fetch and display real-time data dynamically.

I chose the OpenWeatherMap API for this project because it is free and simple to integrate into a single-page application.

"Your Weather Forecast" is a fully interactive web application that allows users to view real-time weather information and a detailed 5-time-point forecast for any city across the globe. The application dynamically fetches weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, and more, and displays it in a clean, user-friendly interface.

This project is a demonstration of front-end development skills, including API integration, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.

FEATURES
~Current Weather Information: Displays real-time weather details for any city, including:
-Temperature
-Humidity
-Wind speed

-Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude)
~5-Time-Point Forecast: Provides forecasted weather conditions for the next 5 time points in 3-hour intervals.
~Dynamic and Responsive Design: A seamless, interactive interface that updates without page reloads.
~Search Functionality:

-Use either the "Search" button or the "Enter" key for convenience.
~Error Handling: Displays a user-friendly error message if the city name is invalid or data cannot be fetched.
